 1)  Which out of the two components (which are performing the same functionality) is performing better and how?
Ans:- On the code performed the Pure-Component Component will perform better thn the Simple-Component Component as the Pure-Component implements  shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow prop and state comparision, whereas in Simple-Component does not implement the shouldComponentUpdate method. It always returs true by default. The Pure-Component does a shallow comparision of previous state with the current state and previous props with the current props and when the shallow comparision indicates that there is a difference the componetn will re-render. This will boost the performance of the Pure-Component than the Simple-Component which re-render each time.
